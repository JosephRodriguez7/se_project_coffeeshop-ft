# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

*Hello there!*
This is my second project in the Software Engineer Bootcamp with TripleTen.

Triple Peaks Coffee Shop helped me reinforce many CSS practices. Such as: z-index implementation, logical layering and positioning of elements within a division (used position relative and absolute).
Additionally, this brief allowed me greater leeway on how to animate parts of the webpage, including the opacity effects, pulsating effects, and scaling effects.

Applied special attention to detail with margins and padding, to avoid horizontal scrolling with screens as small as 1440px wide.

As a result of best responsive practices in CSS, absolute values in pixels were avoided where possible. **This permitted the website to be RESPONSIVE on multiple mobile devices!**

## Skills used within the project:

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- CSS responsive practices
- Custom home-link button embedded in footer logo
- Functional nav links with smooth-scrolling

## Plan on improving the project

In the future, I would like to add very subtle animations (like panning) to the background images. I noticed that the header image does not adapt well to smaller screens, and it appears behind the text. As a future fix, I want to implement an adaptive feature to that image.

Other than that, I am very satisfied with the result!

Hope you like it.
